Project Goals: 

Create an IoT themed device that gathers weather data (air quality), then provides information and action to the user.

Two main sections: 
App - A place for the information to be displayed

Device - Using raspberry pi and add ons, create a device that is able to take in data about the air quality. Will also do data processing. Local storage for the last 7 days, older historical data to perhaps be stored remotely? To be decided.
